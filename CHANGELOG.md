## [Unreleased]

## Added

- `Mxpanel.Operation` struct. This struct holds all the information necessary
to one API operation. It can be delivered alone or grouped in batches.
- `Mxpanel.deliver/2` function.
- `Mxpanel.deliver_later/2` function.

## Changed

- All functions were updated to build a `Mxpanel.Operation` instead of
making a API request directly. The generated operation can be piped to
`Mxpanel.deliver/2` or `Mxpanel.deliver_later/2` to provide a single interface
for delivering information to Mixpanel API. This allow all operations to be batched.
- Default `:pool_size` for `Mxpanel.Batcher` changed from `10` to `System.schedulers_online()`.
- Buffers info telemetry event metadata changed to return the buffer sizes by supported endpoint.

## Removed

- `Mxpanel.Event` struct. Now the build of the event can be made directly
in the `Mxpanel.track/4` function.
- `Mxpanel.track_later/2`. Superseded by `Mxpanel.deliver_later/2`
